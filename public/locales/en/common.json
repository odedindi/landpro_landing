		"text": "We imagine a world where climate-smart farmers, foresters, and administrators value and earn from carbon sequestration. They use LandPro to plan carbon-negative interventions, monitor their impacts, and make these gains available in the carbon market. Companies and Governments looking to offset carbon emissions buy these emissions through LandPro, and involve carbon certification agencies to formalize the offset."

This helps farmers DEMONSTRATE how much carbon they are sequestering with their smart farming practices. LandPro CONNECTS Carbon market actors with those smart farmers, FACILITATES the carbon offset process and INCREASE TRANSPARENCY across the carbon cycle"
